## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a feature-rich e-commerce platform with a focus on:

- Backend integration.
- Comprehensive error handling.
- User-friendly interface.
- Optimized performance and accessibility.

## Tools Used

The following tools were used during the development and testing phases:

- **Postman**: For API testing and debugging.
- **React Testing Library**: For writing and running component tests.
- **TinyPNG**: To optimize image sizes for faster load times.
- **Lighthouse**: For performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices analysis.
- **Browsers**: Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- **OWASP ZAP**: For penetration testing and ensuring web application security.

## Testing Methodology

Our testing approach includes:

1. **API Testing**: Using Postman to verify all endpoints work as expected.
2. **Unit and Integration Testing**: Utilizing React Testing Library to ensure the functionality of individual components.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Compressing images with TinyPNG and analyzing results using Lighthouse.
4. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verifying the application's compatibility across multiple browsers.
5. **Security Testing**: Running vulnerability scans with OWASP ZAP.
